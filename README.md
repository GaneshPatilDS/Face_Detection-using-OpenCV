# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV 👤📷

This Python script uses OpenCV to perform real-time face detection using the Haar Cascade classifier. The application captures video from the default camera, detects faces, and draws rectangles around them. To stop the detection, press the 'q' key.

## Features 🚀

- **Live Face Detection**: The script continuously captures frames from the camera and detects faces in real-time.
- **Haar Cascade Model**: Utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
- **Interactive**: Simply press the 'q' key to stop the face detection process.

## Usage 📸

1. Make sure you have OpenCV installed (`pip install opencv-python`).
2. Run the script.
3. The camera will open, and faces will be detected in real-time.
4. Press the 'q' key to exit the application.

## Requirements 🛠️

- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Notes 📝

- Ensure your camera is properly connected and functional.
